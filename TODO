X -13) FIX BUG that overcounts ( i think ) the number of reads during the mmaped indexing
X -12) raise error for too short reads
-11.5) print out error for nonmapping reads
-11.1) fix snp bug - we need to start adding mutliple reads to the index when a snp is in range
-11.1) fix snp bug - doesnt adjust errors for ref sequences that cover snps
-10) Fix the margianl vs cond prb calculations in print to sam
-5) Fix the 'merge' join - and check the logic
X -3) Finish location node type
X -2) Fix segfault on file bad input names
X -2) Add options for different sequencing error types ( in fastq )
M -1) Fix occasional mapping correctness w/ paied end reads
M ( I cant recreate this after fixing the valgrind memory error, so I 
M   am assuming that this was it, but I'm not certain )
M
0.1) use memset in the trace zeroing ( update trace from reads )
0.8) rename mapped_short_read to packed_mapped_read
0.9) Seperate joining and sam printing
0.95) Fix sam printing for threaded apps and paired end reads
1) Allow users to specify an output directory ( generic chdir )
1.1) Make srue the read len calc is good for paired end reads
2) Cleanup the rawreaddb interface
   i) create a cursor interface
   ii) integrate locking and readkey with the cursor/db interface
   X iii) remove the get_read_from_db function in statmap.c
P 2.1) Make mapped short read location type take a bitfield
P     to conserve on disk storage space
X 2.1) fix mapped_location vs mapped_read_location name confusion
X 2.2) cleanup error codes to make them standard
3) Add checks for paired end reads to ensure the read names are identical 
   ( except slashes )
3.1) Finish on disk indexes
X 4) remove useless code ( esp marshalling code, and ifdef's out code )
4) Add standard error interface code
5) Fix miscount of mapped reads for paired end reads
6) Change chipseq sim to iterate a fixed number of bps, rather than a fixed rate
7) Seperate seq length from *indexed* sequence length in option parsing. ( currently, 
   I say that if the required number of HQ basepairs is too high, that it should be the 
   indexed sequence length. This isnt *exactly* correct, because we could want this feature
   for reads that have varying sizes. )
9) Check the atoi, atof formatting in parse args. 
10) Change the node type to an enum
11) allow mapping of N's ( do lowest quality substitution )
12) Allow mapping of really short reads
13) Create candidate_mappings.h ( and, maybe, mapped_locations.h )
    Currently, mapped_locations, candidate_mappings, and mapped_reads are all in mapped_location.h/c
    This is a bit confusing, and a pretty large file. I should probably split them out into 
    seperate files. 
13b) Do the smae as 13 excpet with db_interface.c, which is way confusing.
